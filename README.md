Crypto_Clustering.ipynb will import the resources\crypto_market_data.csv
and then use 2 different methods for unsupervised machine learning predictive models

The data is scaled prior to either method running.

Method 1 is the KMeans method which relies on all the data points to model its predictions.
Method 2 is the PCA method which works with a subset of the data to gain efficiency while not losing much accuracy.
